<h2>TensorFlow in Python: An Overview</h2>
<p>TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain Team. It's widely used for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. Here's a comprehensive explanation:</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<span>1. Tensors: The fundamental data structure in TensorFlow - multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type</span>
<li>Can be scalars (0-D), vectors (1-D), matrices (2-D), or higher-dimensional arrays</li>
<li>Example: tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])</li>
<br>
<span>2. Graphs: TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs where:</span>
<li>Nodes represent operations</li>
<li>Edges represent tensors flowing between operations</li>
<li>This allows for efficient computation and optimization</li>
<br>
<span>3. Eager Execution: Enabled by default in TF 2.x, allows immediate operation evaluation like standard Python</span>
