<h2>TensorFlow in Python: An Overview</h2>
<p>TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain Team. It's widely used for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. Here's a comprehensive explanation:</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<span>1. Tensors: The fundamental data structure in TensorFlow - multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type</span>
<li>Can be scalars (0-D), vectors (1-D), matrices (2-D), or higher-dimensional arrays</li>
<li>Example: tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])</li>
<br>
<span>2. Graphs: TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs where:</span>
<li>Nodes represent operations</li>
<li>Edges represent tensors flowing between operations</li>
<li>This allows for efficient computation and optimization</li>
<br>
<span>3. Eager Execution: Enabled by default in TF 2.x, allows immediate operation evaluation like standard Python</span>
<h2>Key Components</h2>
<p>Go to the Key-Components.py file and take a look at the code.</p>
<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
<span>1. Deep Learning: Building and training neural networks</span>
<br>
<span>2. Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection</span>
<br>
<span>3. Natural Language Processing: Text classification, machine translation</span>
<br>
<span>4. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting, anomaly detection</span>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<li>Scalability: Can run on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and across multiple devices</li>
<li>Flexibility: From high-level APIs (Keras) to low-level operations</li>
<li>Production-ready: Tools for deployment (TF Serving, TF Lite, TF.js)</li>
<li>Large ecosystem: TensorBoard, TF Hub, TFX, etc.</li>
<h2>Typical Workflow</h2>
<span>1. Data preparation (tf.data API)</span>
<br>
<span>2. Model building (Keras or custom models)</span>
<br>
<span>3. Training (with automatic differentiation)</span>
<br>
<span>4. Evaluation</span>
<br>
<span>5. Deployment</span>
